I started solving this ctf by going to the website it wanted me to find the
ctf on. The ctf was called cookies to the first place I started looking
was in the cookies section on the web page. You have one cookie and the
value of the cookie changes depending on what cookie you put into the
text box. Once I figured all this out I opened Burp Suite and started an
attack on the value from the values -1 to 30. It gave me a lot of
valid parameters but once stood out because it was significantly smaller
than the rest. #20 was 1200 in size in stead of the average of 1900
so I knew I should take a look at it and I ended up finding the ctf.
