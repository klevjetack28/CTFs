On the web page in the about section there is a parameter with the name
notify_true that has a long string that is just upper and lower case
letters. If you put this string of characters in a file and decode it 
using 'base64 --decode flag.enc' it will print out a string containing
the flag.

Flag: picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_1f832615}
