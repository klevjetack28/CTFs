The solution to this ctf was fairly complex. The way you started was by using a program called gobuster which is a brute
force directories on web servers. You use gobuster in combination with dirb which provides a large wordlist to search
for certain directories that may exist on a web server. When you run them together you get the command
    "gobuster dir -u http://atlas.picoctf.net:<port>/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt".
This command returns a couple of files that you will have the option of viewing in the website. The first file is a file
called robot.txt which can be used to view another file. The second one is a directory which is named 'uploads' which
should be where all the files go to be uploaded. We then trick the program by writing a webshell script that is disguised
as a PNG file when in reality it is a PHP file. We then go to the file in the web URL and now have an interface to type
commands. The first thing I though to type was to search for all .txt files. There was one with a weird name that I had
access to and when I went into the file it showed the flag.
