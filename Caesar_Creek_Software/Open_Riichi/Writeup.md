In this challenge I was given a .pcapng file. After analyzing the traffic by following the TCP Stream on stream 18 the entire stream contains a keylog file. After downloading the contents of the keylog file I was able to set the TLS (Pre)-Master-Secret log file to the keylog I downloaded from the capture packet. This decrypts the TLS stream which I am now able to follow and after following and looking at some of the streams I noticed that there are some Unicode encoded strings and after decoding them on stream 16 of the TLS Stream one of the strings decoded into the flag.
