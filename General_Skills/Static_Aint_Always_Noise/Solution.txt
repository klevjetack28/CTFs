When you solve this ctf you need to download both the bach file and the binary.

After both are downloaded run the bash file with the binary as input.
$ bash ltdis.sh static

This will use the static binary as the input to the bash script and return a txt file containing all the strings inside the file. One of those trings in the 'static.ltdis.strings.txt' file will be the flag.
