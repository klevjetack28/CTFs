The solution to this ctf was the use a fundamentals of a binary search
algorithm to guess the number. you start in the middle and it tells
you higher or lower which determines which side the number is on. You can
use this to eliminate half of the numbers each time you guess so it will 
take log(n) guesses to guess the number, n being the number of elements
you have.
