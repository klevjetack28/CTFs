The solution to this ctf was to decrypt the message with base64. We know they used base64 because it is all lower and
upper case characters and also has two equals signs at the end which is padding for base64. Once we decrypt it once we
notice it decrypts into another base64 messae for the same reason. After we decrypt that message we gey a message that
appears to have been through a cipher. It was put through a caesar cipher and you can easily run a 
"tr '[A-Za-z]' '[T-ZA-St-za-z]'" which will translate each letter in a string like a caesar cipher will and give you the
flag.
